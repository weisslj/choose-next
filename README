choose-next
Chooses a file from a directory. Very handy to re-watch tv series!

=====================
Motivation
=====================

Sometimes (when recovering from a hangover, being depressed, etc.)
all you want is to lie in bed an watch a few Futurama/Malcolm episodes.
But even navigating to the right folder and choosing an episode which
you haven't seen yesterday is too much work.

With this small and simple script all you have to do is to type "playfuturama"
(using tab completion of course!) if you have set up e.g. this alias:

alias playfuturama='choose-next -c "mplayer -fs" "/media/usb/Futurama"'


=====================
Usage
=====================

Usage: choose-next [OPTION]... DIR [FILE]...

Chooses a file from directory DIR (recursively) and print it's name to stdout.
Afterwards it is appended to a log file. Only files which are not in log file
are considered for selection. Tries to choose the file which is next in
lexical order in DIR.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CMD, --command=CMD
                        execute CMD on every selected file; %s in CMD is
                        substituted with the filename, otherwise it is
                        appended to CMD
  --clear               remove log file and exit
  --clear-first         remove first log file entry and exit
  --clear-last          remove last log file entry and exit
  --dump                dump log file to stdout and exit
  -i, --no-read         don't use log file to filter selection
  -L FILE, --logfile=FILE
                        path of log file (default:
                        ~/.choose-next/${DIR//\//_})
  -l, --last            play last played file
  -n NUM, --number=NUM  number of files to select (-1: infinite)
  -p, --prepend         prepend selected filename instead of appending
  -q, --quiet           don't output anything
  -r, --random          choose a random file from DIR
  -v, --verbose         be verbose (can be used multiple times)
  -w, --no-write        don't record selected files to log file

Examples
=====================

1. Over the next few weeks you want to watch all Futurama episodes in strict
   rotation:

   # clear existing log file
   choose-next --clear /media/usb/Futurama
   # no special options needed
   alias playfuturama='choose-next -c "mplayer -fs" "/media/usb/Futurama"'

2. You want to see a random episode (out of order!), but not one you have
   already seen. You want to prepend the filename so that the rotation
   order is retained:

   playfuturama -rp

3. You were somehow distracted, and want to watch the last episode again:

   playfuturama -l

4. You want to watch a specific episode, and continue to watch from this
   point on:

   playfuturama -n10 "/media/usb/Futurama/S04E01.avi"
